I was scared of Math. But something happened when I was in college that made me go back to Math. The root of my problem: Not understanding how to study Math. After failing a course in my program which is Math-heavy, I bought myself a College Algebra book, and taught myself again about Math! I'm still doing it now as you are reading it. (I want to finish the book!)")
